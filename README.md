# iKids Newborn Cognitive Unity

This project is a rebuild of the existing ikids-newborn-cognitive task but in Unity for increased performance and flexibility.

The key flexible performance comes from the use of JSON files to specify the program's performance (in the form of a large state machine). See the Documentation folder for both the original and condensed documentation that was used to construct the program. In particular, note the example JSON files which contain the descriptions of the stimuli progression in the task. These files can be modified to modify the program to presenta any stimulus as desired.
