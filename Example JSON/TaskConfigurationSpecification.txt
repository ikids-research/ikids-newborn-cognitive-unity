-XBoxController button names can be found here http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Xbox360Controller , and are the names in the Input column (minus the words "Button" and "Click" with any leading or trailing white space trimmed off
-All strings in JSON files must have escaped characters appropriately (path names, for instance, must be \\ instead of just \)
-Use http://jsonlint.com/ for validating the JSON is correctly formatted
